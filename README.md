A fertilizer prediction project typically involves the development of a system that uses machine learning algorithms to recommend the most suitable fertilizer for a particular type of soil and crop.The goal of this project is to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability by predicting the optimal fertilizer usage for crops. By analyzing soil composition, crop type, and other environmental factors, the system provides tailored fertilizer recommendations that can help farmers increase yield and reduce waste.The goal of this project is to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability by predicting the optimal fertilizer usage for crops.
